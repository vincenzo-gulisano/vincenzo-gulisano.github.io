Documentation:

1. [Basic concepts](docs/basics.md)
2. [Sources, operators and sinks](docs/sourcesopssinks.md)
3. [Statistics](docs/stats.md)

Please notice: you probably want to have a look at some of the papers you can find in my webpage (and the references they cite) to get familiar with some of the concepts discussed in the documentation (e.g., *deterministic* processing).
